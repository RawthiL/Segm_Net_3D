# TensorFlow 3-D Segmentation Networks Library #

This library contains at the moment:
* 3-D U-net (or V-net) using dice loss and batch normalization
* 3-D Convolutional Autoencoder using dice loss/crossentropy and batch normalization

### How do I set it up? ###

* TensorFlow 1.12 (GPU recomended)
* Configuration: Just import it
* Dependencies: Numpy, skimage (for shape generation in example)
* How to run tests:
Open the jupyter notebooks and hit "run"
